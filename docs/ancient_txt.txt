The source for this era is the Cheitharol Kumbaba, the royal chronicle of Manipur or Kangleipak.
Nongda Lairen Pakhangba (33–154 AD) was ruler and the creator of Manipur (or Meeteileipak or Kangleipak). He was the first crowned historical ruler whose reign began in 33 according to the Cheitharol Kumbaba. Meitei culture took root during the reign of Pakhangba as did sagol kangjei (polo), with the first match played between the chiefs of different regions. Polo was played in imitation of a game from the traditional Hayachak era. Laisna took a major role in organizing the game.
Pakhangba was succeeded by his son, Khuiyoi Tompok, in 154 AD. Known as the inventor of the drum (pung), his reign was a peaceful one. Technical innovation in metallurgy was also recorded in the chronicle.
Naophangba (428–518 AD)
The treatise on the construction of the places of Kangla and Kangla Houba are believed to have been written by Ashangba Laiba.
Loiyamba Shinyen (1074–1122 AD) was known as the "Great law Giver", his reign was an important period in the history of Kangleibak. Along with the military consolidation of the kingdom, Loiyamba introduced administrative reforms, which provided the backbone of the kingdom's administration for the next seven centuries. He systematized the administrative divisions of the country by creating six lups or divisions as well as introducing the Pana System. He left a well-organized society and economy in Meeteileipak.
